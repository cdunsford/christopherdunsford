        <h2>My Projects</h2>        
        <p id="about-my-projects">I am unable to show my top projects as they are proprietary code owned by my former employer, OpenText. I am; however, able to show
            some small projects that I have been working on. I consider these small projects as playtime in order to sharpen my skillset in areas 
            such as CSS Grids, CSS Flexbox, javascript, and more.
        </p>
        
        <h3>The Christopher Dunsford Portfolio Site</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/cdunsford/christopherdunsford" target="_blank">https://github.com/cdunsford/christopherdunsford</a>
        <img src="./images/portfolio-site-image.PNG" alt="Picture of Christopher's portfolio site" id="site-images">
        <p id="my-portfolio-site">
            You are currently visiting one of my latest projects. This site serves as my portfolio site to not only serve as a way for you to contact me but also is a way 
            for me to showcase my skills. This site uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There is currently no framworks in use (such as Boootstrap).
            I use CSS grids for page layouts. I use CSS flexboxes for content layout. I call out with a social media Javascript link to link my LinkedIn 
            page.

        <h3>Tea Cozy</h3>
        <a href="https://cdunsford.github.io/teacozy2/" target="_blank">https://cdunsford.github.io/teacozy2/</a>
        <img src="./images/teacozy-image.PNG" alt="Picture of Tea Cozy site" id="site-images">
        <p id="teacozy-project">
            Tea Cozy is a project that all CodeCademy (http://www.codecademy.com) students in the Web Development or Full Stack Development track must code.  
            The main idea is to work with page layout using css Flexbox. I did so and I also incorporated responsive design patterns such as using 
            media queries to make the site mobile friendly.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Stuffed Animal Task List</h3>
        <a href="https://cdunsford.github.io/stuffedanimaltasklist/index.html" target="_blank">https://cdunsford.github.io/stuffedanimaltasklist/</a>
        <img src="./images/stuffed-animal-project.PNG" alt="Picture of Stuffed Animal Site" id="site-images">
        <p id="stuffed-animal-project">
            This site is a simple one. I used it to work on the CSS grid technique. There is no functionality incorporated. The idea is from Code Cademy (http://www.codecademy.com)
